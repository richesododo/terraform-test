# Terraform IAM RBAC Implementation for Four different set of users in an AWS Account

## Overview
This Terraform code creates AWS IAM roles named after each group intended for and attaches the required corresponding policy to each.

Each IAM role is allowing only specific users to assume the role, as specified in the "assume_role_policy" blocks. The policy statement allows only the AWS IAM users specified in the "*_allowed_users" variable to assume the role.

The second resource, "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment", attaches the required policy to the IAM role created in the first resource. This policy provides full access to rources required by each group distinctively.

## How Users of the System are managed
The users are managed using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) which is the service that allows you to manage access to AWS resources. By using IAM, users access to the AWS resources are controlled and it is ensured that only authorized users are able to access resources based on permission granted. User activities can also be audited to track who accessed what resources and when, and security best practices such as multi-factor authentication and password policies enforced.

## Assumptions
The code assumes that the AWS provider has been configured with the appropriate access and secret keys, and that the region and account ID are correct.

The code assumes that the variables used in the code (e.g "frontend_name") have been defined with the correct values.

The code assumes that the policies attached are appropriate for the needs of the IAM role being created. Depending on the specific requirements of the application, other policies may be needed to provide the necessary permissions.

The code assumes that the IAM role is being created in the correct AWS account and region. If the code is used across multiple accounts or regions, additional configuration may be needed to ensure that the role is created in the appropriate context.

The code assumes that the resources being created do not already exist, and that there are no conflicts with existing resources. If conflicts do exist, additional configuration may be needed to reconcile the differences.

## Next steps
Other steps would follow depending on the specific needs and goals of the application. It's important to continuously review and improve the infrastructure over time, to ensure that it remains secure, reliable, and efficient
Creating a Terraform module that encapsulates this code, to make it easier to use and maintain across different environments. 
A few steps are:

Setting up monitoring and alerting for the IAM role, to detect and respond to any suspicious or unexpected behavior.

Reviewing and updating the IAM policies and roles periodically, to ensure that they are still appropriate and in line with security best practices.

Exploring additional AWS services that could be used to enhance the project.

Implementing automated testing and deployment pipelines, to ensure that changes to the infrastructure are tested and deployed safely and consistently.

Documenting the IAM policies and roles, and any other infrastructure components, to help with troubleshooting and onboarding new team members.
